# 2025 - Biodiversity Modelling Summer School

Coding biodiversity: building scenarios with a global ecosystem model

## Presentation

*From official description on website*

In our current context, it is urgent that ecologists are trained to project scenarios of future biodiversity. Such biodiversity scenarios, predicting extinctions, community changes and alterations and ecosystem functioning could radically transform our society, like climate change scenarios did. The reputation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change largely builds on robust general circulation models, simulating the physics and chemistry of the planet. It has been proposed that **general ecosystem models** could inform policy decisions and improve our understanding of biodiversity and its functioning. Developing such models is however a daunting task that could only be achieved in team.

The general objective of this edition of the Summer School in **biodiversity modelling** will be to investigate the joint effects of biodiversity changes and climate change on ecosystem functioning using a custom version of the **Madingley model**. Students will learn how to collaborate in a complex coding problem with an inter-disciplinary team, and we encourage people with diverse backgrounds to apply and compose this inter-disciplinary teams.

### Themes

* Modelling scenarios for decision makers
* Ecological forecasting
* Unifying ecology across scales
* Data pipelines
* Communicating biodiversity changes for decision makers

## Project scope

* Build a framework of knowledge for the concept of climatic scenarios
  * What is its history, what does it communicate, how is it communicated, how is it used, what are the methodologies behind it
  * Who are the actors, users and stakeholders of climatic scenarios, what are their needs, how to communicate with them
  * What is the workflow, from data to communication and decision making

* Build a framework of knowledge for the concept of Biodiversity scenarios
  * What is expected from global biodiversity scenarios, what ipbess has to say about it, what is proposed in the literature
  * What are the main challenges, what are the main questions, what are the main methodologies
  * Who are the users and stakeholders of biodiversity scenarios, what are their needs, how to communicate with them
  * What artefacts and products are expected from biodiversity scenarios

* Build an understanding of a general ecosystem model
  * What is the Madingley model, how does it work, what are its components, underlaying assumptions and mechanisms
  * How a general ecosystem model can be used to build scenarios

* What are the technical requirements to create the model and use it for scenarios building
  * What are the variables : input, output, parameters, etc.
  * What are the data requirements, how to access them, how to use them
  * What are the libraries and tools to use
  * What is the workflow

* Create technical documentation for students and future users
  * A guide to install and run the model
  * A guide to modify the model using input data and parameters
  * A guide to modify the c++ processes of the model
  * A guide to run the model on a HPC
